1) assignment
assign the "Hello everyone," 
using assign (s, t) to the string variable string1; 
then using assign (s, t) again, "I love you!" is assigned to the string variable string2, 
and then string1 and string2 are merged 
concatenated with concat (s, t) to get the string string3, 
and display the string3 and its length on the screen. 
2) find out the sequence string 
using the substring subStr (s, k, len) string3 starts with the 7th character, 
and the continuous 4 characters after the 19th character, 
and display it on the screen.
3) delete 
string to delete 8 consecutive characters from the seventh character in the delStr (s, I, j) string3, 
and then insert the position of the seventh character of the string3 with "Data Structure". 
The inserted string string3 and its length are displayed on the screen.
